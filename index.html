                </div>
                Real estate is both the land and permanent structures which include residences
                and any enhancements attached to the land. It is a type of real
                property which differs from personal property that is not attached to the land.
                Personal property includes vehicles, boats, jewelry, and more.

                The <b>top 20 countries</b> in property distribution is visualized with
                <b>Russia</b> ranking at the <b>highest</b> position. This prominence can be
                attributed to Russia's vast landmass, covering an extensive <b>17.1 million square
                    kilometers</b>. The large geographical area of the country contributes
                significantly to its property distribution which makes it a notable presence in the
                global real estate market. However, other factors such as economic conditions,
                population growth, real estate market conditions and more also play a crucial role
                in listing properties across the world.

                The analysis of property trends from <b>2010</b> to <b>2023</b> reveals <b>decrease</b> and
                <b>cyclical</b>
                patterns in average property prices and a simultaneous <b>increase</b> in the number of listings.
                However,
                from <b>2024</b> to <b>2028</b>, a noteworthy shift occurs as average property prices begin to
                <b>rise</b>, while the number of listings <b>declines</b>. This shift can be due to a <b>potential
                    reduction</b> in property construction, resulting in <b>decreased market availability</b>.
                Furthermore,
                the rising property prices during this period may be indicative of <b>improvements in property
                    quality</b>
                which attract buyers to invest in <b>higher-priced, higher-quality</b> homes. These findings underscore
                the
